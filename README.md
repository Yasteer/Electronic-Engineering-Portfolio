# 🧠 Electronic Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my **Electronic Engineering Portfolio** — a curated collection of hands-on projects that demonstrate my skills, creativity, and technical ability in electronic circuit design, embedded systems, and control engineering.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a **portfolio of evidence** showcasing my competency in various areas of electronic engineering. Each project is crafted to highlight key aspects of electronics, from basic circuit analysis and component selection to microcontroller programming and real-world applications.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a **standalone project**, and typically contains the following:

- 📐 **Circuit Diagram** – A schematic to illustrate the system's architecture  
- 📏 **Component Sizing Calculations** – Design calculations and reasoning behind selected component values  
- 🧠 **Theoretical Write-up** – A detailed explanation of how the circuit works  
- 💾 **Source Code** – Embedded software (Arduino, STM32, etc.) if the project involves microcontrollers  
- 📊 **Waveforms and Measurements** – Oscilloscope captures or simulation outputs where applicable

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

- Analog and digital electronics
- Microcontrollers (Arduino, STM32, etc.)
- Circuit simulation tools (LTspice, Proteus, etc.)
- PCB design (KiCad, EasyEDA, etc.)
- Programming languages: C/C++, Structured Text, Python (where applicable)

## 📌 How to Use This Repo

Feel free to browse through the project folders to get a glimpse into my design thinking and engineering process. Each project folder includes its own `README.md` for more in-depth information.

This portfolio is constantly evolving as I explore new concepts and take on more ambitious builds. 🚀
